# Python Invoice Generator.

This repository contains the final project for CS111 Course at University of Toronto. Instead of opting to work with 
other teammates, I ended up building this project myself as I was stuck in a very different timezone than the rest of
my classmates. This project was inspired by my hopes of automating some part of my dad's job, which involves creating
bank reconciliations and invoices for businesses in UK. This project was a first attempt and a generic version. 

### How to run this:

Run the main.py file with Python, and enter the information for the Invoice.
Click on generate Invoice then navigate to the Invoices folder and open the Invoice.pdf!

To see the autocomplete tree structure, use the print function in the console for the display method of the two 
autocomplete trees, (autocomplete_tree_payer , autocomplete_tree_vendor).

The data folder contains the csv files for the sample list of Vendors and Payers

The CSC111 folder contains the project report in a PDF format detailing the process of creation of the code.
